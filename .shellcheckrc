# ShellCheck configuration for MinUI
# Start forgiving, tighten over time

# Disable these common warnings that are too noisy for now
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing
# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# SC2164: Use 'cd ... || exit' (many scripts rely on cd working)
# SC2046: Quote to prevent word splitting
# SC2006: Use $() instead of backticks (style, too many to fix now)
# SC2005: Useless echo (style issue)
# SC2003: expr is antiquated (style issue)
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source (too many dynamic sources)
# SC2295: Expansions inside ${..} (minor issue)
