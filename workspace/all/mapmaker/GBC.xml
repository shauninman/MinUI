    <name>007: The World is Not Enough</name>
    <desc>It seems that an MI-6 agent has been killed just before delivering a report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department.  As James Bond (yes, the James Bond), you're going to need your license to kill in order to find out who killed him, and return some stolen money to the King.  Based on the 1999 Bond film of the same title, 007: The World Is Not Enough spans 14 levels, each with several objectives.  Using all of the weapons and gadgetry you can get your hands on, you'll be challenged to upend a terrorist attack, free hostages from a train station, and much more.  To help you in your endeavors, you'll have access to a bomb disposal kit, digital camera, covert modem, grapple hook watch, night vision glasses, and about a dozen other items of the like.  The game lets you pick your character, your environment, a range of weapons that will be in play, and a scenario.  This adventure offers three different difficulty levels.</desc>

    <desc>If you're really looking for arcade hits, you can't get much bigger than JOUST and DEFENDER. Lording over the game halls in the days after PAC-MAN and DONKEY KONG had lost their luster, these two giants revolutionized gaming forever. JOUST casts you in the role of a noble knight from the future mounting you on an ostrich and sending you off into battle. Making full use of the ostrich, you'll try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot's seat of an aerodynamic space ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege. You'll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do battle with a friend.</desc>

Whenever you defeat a monster, you gain their unique card which can be tapped to summon said monster to join you in your quest. You can have up to two monsters fighting by your side at any time, and they level up and gain experience just like you do.</desc>

    <name>Asteroids</name>
    <desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

    <desc>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do.  In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.

Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig."</desc>

    <name>Ballistic</name>
    <desc>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.

Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.</desc>

    <name>Balloon Fight GB</name>
    <desc>Balloon Fight GB is a color remake of Balloon Kid. 
 
All features from Balloon Kid are still intact. The main new addition is that there is color. There is now also a world map, and the title screen and menu systems are slightly different. Through the world map, levels are given names, which were previously unknown since Balloon Kid did not give any names to areas or levels. 
 
Balloon Fight GB is notoriously rare, and it was distributed via the Nintendo Power Flash cartridge, which is no longer supported by Nintendo. As such, copies of this game downloaded onto one of these cartridges can get high prices and rarely is ever sold. Due to the nature of this cartridge, the game would have had to been downloaded onto the cartridge before the service was discontinued. 
 
This game is available today on the 3DS eShop as a Game Boy Color Virtual Console game. However, the game is only available through the Japan eShop, so 3DS owners in Europe and America cannot download the software. 
 
After the Nintendo Power cartridge writing service was shut down, it was possible to order prewritten Nintendo Power cartridges with Balloon Fight GB over the phone, and these versions came with a fold-out manual and a large button with the game's box art, among other things.</desc>

    <name>Barbie : Pet Rescue</name>
    <desc>Barbie Pet Rescue lets kids play with and care for a variety of domesticated animals. Visit Barbie and her kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where you'll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or tend to pets in the Care Center.

Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet is missing where, travel with Barbie on her scooter to one of three different environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In many missions, you'll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to retrieve pets trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each successful mission, you'll receive a printable Paw &amp; Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall.

Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for their owners and receive a little TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care Center, where you'll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and grooming. You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After creating a file for them in the computer and giving them a name you select from a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two playrooms to wait for their owners.

In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the playroom--a kitten, bunny, hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal you'd like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal's head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over, purring, or barking.
 
There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you'll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players' mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.</desc>

    <desc>Beyblade Fighting Tournament was the second video game released. This game features some concepts and ideas that were later abandoned within the Beyblade franchise, though many ideas were continued on within the manga and anime. 
 
The standard game play involves visiting locations and the player fights their way through tornements to advance to the next stage of the game. As each tornement was won, more parts and bit-beasts are made able to be bought from the games shop. 
The player could only start with one of 4 arch-types, "Dragoon", "Draciel", "Dranzer" and "Driger". Intially by default the player could only choose Dragoons, although codes were released in magazines to acess the other arch-types. 
 
Within each match, however, aside from the launch the player had virtually no control on the beyblade once it was in the arena, resulting in many matchses being won more based on luck and the beyblades strength then player skill.</desc>

She'll ask Billy Bob to fetch her rabbits or bass, and it's up to you to help Billy Bob get them. Obviously, to get the things she wants you'll have to either go hunting or fishing. Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you've finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you'll head out to catch your real prize. BILLY BOB'S HUNTIN' AND FISHIN' is for one player and is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

    <name>Boarder Zone</name>
    <desc>Game Boy Color version of Boarder Zone is substantially different from its PC namesake.

This version features a pseudo-3D environment, where the camera is positioned behind the boarder and the piste scrolls towards the camera. Obstacles appear on the horizon and increase in size as they near the viewpoint.

The two main game modes are 'Competition' and 'Challenge'.

Competition features a 'race attack' mode (basically a speed race with another AI player), Trick Attack (trick points based over 5 courses, beating a course threshold to advance), Time Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack (race with tricks).

Challenge modes is about beating any previous records set for a particular track and supported Time Attack (best time), Trick Attack (best trick points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), and Vs Race (which uses the Game Boy Universal Link Cable).

There is also a practice mode and a 'ghost boarder' - basically a replay of the player's best race.

Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty Air, Meloncholy, Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, Front Flip, Back Flip, Rodeo Flip, and McTwist; most of which are performed with combo style control moves.

The player can choose from four characters: Sandy, Travis, Alain, and Tara.</desc>

    <desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

    <desc>Columns was to the Game Gear what Tetris was to the Game Boy. Some years after the Game Gear had ceased production, it was ported to the 'Boy. To spice things up, the game has been given several game modes, and, most notably, a licence to several popular manga characters created by Osamu Tezuka. Play as famous characters such as Astro Boy, Kimba or Black Jack.

Apart from the main Columns mode, this edition features a puzzle mode like that of the Nazo Puyo games, where you must remove a set of pre-installed pieces using a set of pre-defined dropping pieces. There is also a link-up mode for battling with friends.

The Tezuka characters play no big role in the game, being displayed in a window to the right of the playfield, changing mimics according to how the game progresses. You have six characters to choose from, and three save slots to put them in. The save slots let you keep your score for upcoming sessions.</desc>

    <name>Dancing Furby</name>
    <desc>As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! Shake it to the left, shake it to the right.

A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger Electronics, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. 

Dancing Furby operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, "noo-loo" being perfect, "e-day" being acceptable, and "boo" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in "noo-loo"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.

Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble Für Elise when you least expect it.

You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.

Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Für Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.</desc>

    <desc>Acclaim's foray into trick-based BMX games spawned a unique version for the Game Boy Color.

The basic design is the same as in the original console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme sports games. In career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.

In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.

The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</desc>

You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.</desc>

The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.

The following routes are available:

Whenever the player makes a mistake, points are deducted from a counter which at the start of each round is initialized to a value depending on the selected difficulty. If it reaches zero, the game is over.

    <name>Disney's The Emperor's New Groove</name>
    <desc>What would you do if someone turned you into a llama? Based on the animated film from Disney, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE casts you in the role of a young Incan ruler named Kuzco. When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma's dastardly minions will be after you, but you'll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you'll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There'll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that's rightfully yours. Good luck, llama!</desc>

    <desc>Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find DOGZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

    <name>Donkey Kong Country</name>
    <desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</desc>

    <name>Driver : You are the Wheelman</name>
    <desc>In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. 

Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. 

Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.

Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.</desc>

All the while, Earth-based authorities will try to apprehend you, so make sure you bring your wits and reflexes to the table. There are 45 quests in all, each of which presents new traps and obstacles to avoid, and the game even has three separate difficulty levels to master. With six main game areas and 10 detailed environments, E.T.

In League mode, you'll play through a full season that culminates in the playoffs to see who is the greatest. Finally, Indoor mode takes the game inside and changes up the rules a little bit, resulting in a fast-paced version of the original. Options available for every mode include weather settings, foul settings, wind, and more. You can also use the password to save all of your stats in League and Tournament modes.</desc>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

For example, indirect attack units can now move and attack at the same time in one turn. In contrast to the previous Game Boy Wars titles, having the required fund is not enough to produce certain units. The player must provide construction materials to the factories and cities as well. To do that, the player must deploy construction units to these sites and built the materials. These construction units can be used to cut down trees and create roads.</desc>

    <desc>Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! marks another platformer entry in the Ganbare Goemon series. Forgoing RPG touches, the game returns to the action / platformer roots of the 16-bit titles by casting you as Goemon and his pal Ebisumaru as they traverse several levels based on a bizarre version of feudal Japan in hopes of defeating the forces of an evil alien invader.

The Game alternates between stages featuring either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each character takes a different route towards the bad guy and as a result the stages scroll differently for each character. You can collect upgraded items and weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features mid-level bonus rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade mini-games as traditional for the series.</desc>

    <desc>Godzilla: The Series is based off the TV show on Fox, which was in turn based off the 1998 film starring Matthew Broderick. In this game, the player takes control of the big guy himself as giant monsters from space have invaded Earth and are determined to destroy it. Unfortunately for both the aliens and Godzilla the military is out to destroy both, so Godzilla now has to fight off the military to throw back the alien menace.

There are seven levels in all. The player will travel through each level destroying the military to reach the end of the level and fight the boss monster. The only control the player has over Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla will walk on his own from left to right on the screen in a linear path. There are four attacks to choose from: Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous Radiation Breath.</desc>

    <desc>The GameBoy Color version of Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado is a side-scrolling platformer that follows the main events of the animated movie.

Through many levels you control one of two main characters: Tulio or Miguel. They can walk, run, jump, climb, collect objects, and use cutlasses. In most levels you should proceed from one part of level to another collecting a certain number of items, sometimes significant ones such as parts of a map showing the way to El Dorado. Different opponents will try to prevent your progress, but they can be either avoided or eliminated.

Different arcade sequences such as running away from a bull or riding a horse as well as several battles with bosses are present. Such encounters include fights with a cougar, Cortez himself, and also playing Indian basketball against the Indian champion.</desc>

There is a story mode featuring a family of archaeologists who are digging up Japanese orthography across the globe. Sweden, for instance, is known not only as being the home of lost Atlantis but also troves of buried Japanese writing! A family member is missing perhaps there will be clues in this the ruins of these global ancient Japanese ruins?

    <name>Grand Theft Auto</name>
    <desc>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the 
big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.

Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.

The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</desc>

    <name>Hanasaka Tenshi Tenten-kun no Beat Breaker</name>
    <desc>Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle game.  Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.

Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.

When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.</desc>

    <desc>As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.

You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</desc>

    <name>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</name>
    <desc>The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.

To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).

Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.

Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu. </desc>

    <desc>In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Color, the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the form of a traditional role-playing game.

Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, battling monsters and gaining experience and levels.

Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use a variety of spells against various critters and other enemies. In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can be used to produce powerful magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients.

As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the end.

The game features several mini-games that, once found in the main game, can also be accessed from the main menu.</desc>

The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly.

Your many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the budget while purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, etc) at the local stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).</desc>

    <desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>

    <name>Hexcite: The Shapes of Victory</name>
    <desc>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.

Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)

In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</desc>

The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels. 

There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.</desc>

    <name>Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000</name>
    <desc>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios.

Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.
The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.

While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</desc>

Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

    <desc>Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the carrots.

Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present.

Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.

Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.

If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.

Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</desc>

    <name>Lucky Luke</name>
    <desc>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.

Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</desc>

Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more.

As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.

Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.</desc>

The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and defeating other students, you're able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you're not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds.

In addition to the main game, there's also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.</desc>

    <desc>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen star in the portable adventure about junior detectives who can "solve any crime by dinnertime."

Each mystery they solve is presented as a puzzle.  Each level gives you one piece of the puzzle.  Solve the entire puzzle and you've solved the mystery.

Each level has you switching control between three characters: Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog, Clue.  Each character has different abilities.  Ashley can flip switches to open doors and the cage in which the puzzle piece is hidden.  She can also pick Clue up and throw him.  Clue can be thrown and he can swim.  Other characters can stand on him to get a bit of a boost to their jumps as well.  Mary-Kate serves as a trampoline of sorts.  The other characters can bounce on her head for a big jump boost.  She can also jump the highest of the three.

In each level, you must use the special abilities of all characters to remove obstacles,open the cage that contains the puzzle piece and reach piece.  There are five mysteries in all, each with eleven stages, for a total of fifty-five levels of puzzle-solving.</desc>

Someone has torn up the map that the twins were going to use to get to the shindig, and now they must pool their resources and find all of the pieces before the party starts without them. Some of the map is split up between the classrooms at school, some of them are in the hands of some weird girl that won't give them back, and others have completely disappeared.

One of the game's best features is a creative music-making program that allows kids to punch in their own cool beats and tunes. You'll start out the game in the freshman class, but piecing together the map and completing a few of the side games will earn you a pass to the higher grades.

    <desc>Mary Kate and Ashley: Winner's Circle is an isometric horse racing game.  You pick either one of the Olsens, and a horse, then an event.  Most events are essentially clock or checkpoint race where you must make it through the track or jump all the gates before time runs out, but there are also challenge stages with more varied goals such as collection.

Controls can be done either Mary-Kate style, where you use left and right to turn the horse, or Ashley style, where the horse will point in the direction you press on the D-pad.  In both cases, B kicks the horse to get them moving and A signals them to jump.</desc>

    <name>Metal Gear Solid</name>
    <desc>Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.

The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</desc>

    <name>Metal Walker</name>
    <desc>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.  This "core" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.

The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.

The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.

There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.

As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</desc>

    <name>Mickey's Racing Adventure</name>
    <desc>Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.

Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.

The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.

The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.

Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</desc>

    <name>Mickey's Speedway USA</name>
    <desc>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!

Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.

The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).

There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.

Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</desc>

    <desc>Tiny cars race through the house in MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo. Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.</desc>

    <desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

    <name>Mobile Golf</name>
    <desc>In 2001, Nintendo and Camelot released a Japan-only sequel for Mario Golf (GBC) called Mobile Golf. 
 
It can be considered an expansion: the same game engine but with new courses, new golfers, new minigames and even an exclusive mini-golf mode that never appeared again in the series. It lacks a story mode, but all RPG elements (experience, leveling up, skill points...) for character building are still there. 
 
But what it made it so special was its Mobile Adapter compatibility, a special link cable that allowed internet connection through a cellphone. This allowed for massive multiplayer tournaments to be held, where participants could get amazing prizes like special clubs for use in-game and even extra courses and characters that could be considered DLC somehow. 
 
There is now a fan translation patch which also changes the way DLC is unlocked in-game, so you can unlock them (courses, characters, minigames and clubs) by playing the single-player modes.</desc>

Powerups to be collected are Blort cans, which in addition to being Mike's ammunition function as health - being damaged only means losing a few cans. There are also boxes of Chinese takeout food (collect 10 for an extra life) and teddy bears (instant one up).</desc>

    <desc>NFL BLITZ 2000 brings fast-paced, no-holds-barred football action to the field. Rather than offering a standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL BLITZ 2000.</desc>

    <desc>If you're a football fanatic looking for arcade-style gridiron action, then NFL BLITZ 2001 from Midway is right up your alley. Take all the tiresome rules and regulations of standard football and throw them out the window BLITZ is fast, furious, and out of control. Real-life NFL stars are modeled here in a brutish, cartoon-inspired fashion and their burly physiques are perfect for inflicting damage on your opponents. Listen and laugh at humorous commentary from the in-game announcer and garner helpful hints from the sexy cheerleaders as you attack your way upfield towards the goal line. And you can savor all the bone-crushing pigskin mayhem again and again in a helmet-cracking replay mode. You'll watch in awe as your team catches fire after a series of excellent plays. Compete in four stadiums new to the franchise like the "Stadium of the Future," watch the action from a range of angles (including Blimp view), go head-to-head in Single-Player competition, and much more. Taunting, tackles, and touchdowns are all part of the "First -and-Goal Frenzy" of NFL BLITZ 2001.</desc>

    <desc>The first PC conversion of the arcade hit, NFL Blitz gives the National Football League the same over-the-top treatment that Midway had used so effectively with NBA Jam.  Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player models, "turbo" buttons, fast action, and some pretty wild rules changes (like 30 yards for a first down!). Blitz is nothing if not a unique football gaming experience.

Player taunts ("This is MY HOUSE!"), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers ("That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!") all add to the game's violent charm.</desc>

    <desc>Nicktoons Racing for the Game Boy Color is conceptually similar to its console counterpart. It's a kart racing game but on the handheld it is viewed from a top down perspective. Some of the most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them. 

Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific order. 

The game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:

1. Tommy
2. Eliza
3. CatDog
4. Arnold
5. SpongeBob SquarePants
6. Dagget
7. Norbert

Tracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There's numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will increase the car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.</desc>

    <name>Pac-Man : Special Color Edition</name>
    <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

Before she does, though, she has one final field test to complete - an actual mission in the depths of the South American jungle.  Joanna must infiltrate a hidden cyborg manufacturing facility.  Along the way, she will have her first encounter with the nefarious dataDyne corporation.

Perfect Dark is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  Players assume the role of Joanna Dark, just before her induction into the Carrington Institute.  The game plays from a top-down perspective, and you battle enemies with a variety of high-tech weaponry, from handguns to rocket launchers. A weapon can be assigned to the A Button and the B Button, which represent your left hand and your right hand.  It's also possible to search dead enemies for items and ammo by pressing Select near their corpse.

Perfect Dark also includes a variety of mini-games which you encounter as you progress through the story.  There are target ranges to practice in, vehicles to drive, sniper rifle sections, which are viewed through the sniper scope, and more.  There are also boss battles against enemy cyborgs, helicopters, and other deadly enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.</desc>

    <desc>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.

This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</desc>

    <name>Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun</name>
    <desc>Puyo Puyo Sun is the third entry in the main Puyo Puyo series of real-time puzzle games, its title being a pun involving the Japanese word for "three". The evil Dark Prince has caused the sun to augment its size and power to dangerous levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the verge of being scorched unless you prevent it.

The game features three distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a different set of enemies which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play areas, one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like "puyos" start falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.

New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 2P vs gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and other bonus features.</desc>

The new system uses a unique special skill system, which allows players to combine characters with their favorite special skills. In addition, while Puyo Puyo Party on the Nintendo 64 was defensive, an offensive one that affects the opponent's field has been added, and the display of SP required for the specifications of special skills has been changed to a gauge type. 
 
The aforementioned special skills can be obtained by advancing through the "Challenge Mode" of "Hitori Puyo Puyo". In "Hitori de Puyo Puyo," you can also play "Renshu," in which you play against three other players, "Sutori," in which Aruru defeats enemies to learn special skills, "Training," in which you can choose your favorite character and play against the CPU, and "Challenge," in which you can defeat randomly appearing enemies to use special skills in all modes.

    <desc>Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjo!, released March 28, 2001, is the Japanese-exclusive sequel to the original Pokémon Trading Card Game, also for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo, and was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.  
 
Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi.

In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne's world as "hunny").

Much to Pooh and Tigger's collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you'll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.</desc>

4 amazing game modes 
 
The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball and paddle. Gems "fall in" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy. 
 
The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over. 
 
The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.</desc>

The goal is to change all of the blocks to the appropriate color by hopping on them. As the game progresses, blocks will require multiple jumps. Complicating the process, a snake that wants to destroy you hops around the course, and there are two balls that go down parts of the course undoing all of your work. There are more than 40 levels to complete with several that are larger than one screen. Since all of the action in the game moves in diagonals, there are two different control schemes to maximize your fun.

    <name>Rampage : World Tour</name>
    <desc>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.

The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.

The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</desc>

The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</desc>

Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs. Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time. He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.

    <desc>Following the success of the original PlayStation edition of Resident Evil in 1996, Capcom expanded the game in a number of ports - one of those planned was for the GameBoy Color. In 1999, HotGen Studios, Ltd., a company in the United Kingdom, was selected by Capcom to port the game. 
 
HotGen designed the game to be a direct-conversion of the PlayStation version following the same single-player paths as other versions with options to play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. New additions were also planned including a greater variety in enemies and the ability to disarm traps. A new save feature was also in development, removing the need for Ink Ribbons and finding save points. 
 
However, after sending the finished product to Capcom for evaluation, the company turned it away. Their official statement in 2000 claimed that they were "not confident that the product would have made both consumers and Capcom happy."</desc>

    <name>Resident Evil: Gaiden</name>
    <desc>It's believed that Umbrella, the creators of the deadly virus that wiped out Raccoon City, has developed a new Bio Organic Weapon on a cruise ship called the Starlight, which is on its way to Europe. One S.T.A.R.S. member, Leon S Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) was sent out to destroy the weapon, but the team have been unable to contact him since he arrived at the ship.

Using a combination of top down side-scrolling action and 1st person shooter, it is your job to get aboard the liner, currently floating in the Atlantic Ocean, destroy the weapon and find Leon. Along the way, you'll come across plenty of deadly  undead enemies, similar to those found in the original Resident Evil series, while using a range of weapons and items found in the ship.</desc>

    <name>Road Rash</name>
    <desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

    <desc>Roadsters 98 is a prototype racing game by Genetic Fantasia, with a gameplay similar to Micro Machines, that seems to have been cancelled in early development. A playable demo exists, thanks to a scene leaked ROM from the old GameBoy Color days. While there is a game called Roadsters released in Europe and USA in 2000, it is completely different from Roadster 98. The release group got access to some beta software which is normal but in this case they probably thought they'd do a nice pre-store but the final game never appeared ? unless this is an insanely rare special release no one knows about. 
 
We can speculate that Genetic Fantasia worked on Roadsters GameBoy Color for Titus, but something went wrong and the publisher decided to release a different game.</desc>

You can move around the theme park using a top-down view. Around the park you will find various points of interest where you can play one of the eight side-scrolling platform levels or seven mini-games.

Advancing to the new platform levels requires you to collect tickets which are won through playing the mini-games. Mini-games include target shooting, fishing, shooting hoop, tossing frogs and hammer shot. The events are displayed on a single screen.

The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a pyramid, a pagoda and the Notre Dame. The goal of the game is to eventually find Chuckie a princess to become his new mother.</desc>

    <name>Saru Puncher</name>
    <desc>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. 

Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.

In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. 

During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</desc>

The player can initially choose from eight characters to play (Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Franklin, Sally, Peppermint Patty &amp; Schroeder) each with their unique strengths and weaknesses.

There are four different courts to choose from, a forest location, the beach, the schoolyard and Charlie Brown's backyard, with an additional four locations unlocked during gameplay.  There are six different single player game modes to choose from:

1. Normal, which is a best two-out-of-three game set.
2. Power, where the player plays a game of tennis with the ability to use power-ups during the match.
3. Points Win, which the player with the most points within a two minutes wins the match.
4. Sudden Win, which has no service breaks and the first player with two victories wins the game.
5. Squash, which is still a normal game of tennis, but adds walls to both sides of the court.

There is also the Championship mode where the player takes on several different characters on different courts in order to win the Peanuts' Tennis Championship and unlock other characters under different difficulty settings (easy, medium and hard).  There is also a two-player mode using a Game Link and supports three languages to choose from (English, French and Spanish).</desc>

    <name>Space Invaders</name>
    <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.

Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn't include the Vs. mode.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages of combat.  He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns.

Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  It contains both horizontal and vertical sections.  You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</desc>

The game is a platformer, divided into several large levels. Progression is not strictly linear: some of the levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning some new fighting moves.

Spidey's special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them. His spider-sense will usually alert him when important locations or special obstacles are near.

The game includes various boss fights with the likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.</desc>

    <name>Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams</name>
    <desc>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

    <name>Stuart Little: The Journey Home</name>
    <desc>This little mouse has one big journey ahead of him, and you're just the one to help him out. Unfortunately, the Little family didn't foresee the possible conflict of interest in keeping a cat and mouse on the same household when they adopted Stuart, and that's proving to be a bit of a problem. Between newfound enemies and domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time! There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The Journey Home, and each one is based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of course, based on the book by E.B. White). You'll end up tackling a mini-golf course, Central Park, a model boat race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in this epic quest for peace. In addition, here are plenty of platforms and hazards to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings ensure that younger gamers and experienced veterans alike will find the game appealing. 
 
In Stuart Little: The Journey Home, kids play as Stuart Little, the clever, ever-cheerful mouse from the popular Stuart Little movie and classic children's book of the same name. In the game, Stuart's just joined the Little family, and there's plenty of action to master, such as sliding down the laundry chute as a shortcut or using the flip-top bin to get more altitude. The Littles also join you in your play, as does Snowbell, the family cat who just can't warm up to even the most lovable of mice. 
 
This side-scrolling game abounds with action that uses many of the movie's favorite locations. The Journey Home's eight levels of gameplay take Stuart through the thrilling model boat race, a topsy-turvy miniature golf course, a toy cowboy town, and New York's Central Park. 
 
Every level is filled with power-ups and items that let you boost your energy and gain points. Three play settings make this a game that kids with varying skill levels can enjoy.</desc>

    <desc>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.

Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening.  Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.

The game also features a unique "merge" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items.  For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</desc>

Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon's characteristic genre name is Dungeon RPG (ãƒ€ãƒ³ã‚¸ãƒ§ãƒ³RPG Danjon RPG?). It is the first sequel in the Tales series, which normally does not have connected storylines. The story begins 205 years after the beginning of Tales of Phantasia. 
 
Due to the limits of the Game Boy, the game uses a battle system called Petit LMBS, a turn-based variation on the Linear Motion Battle System used by the rest of the series. As in normal LMBS, the player controls only one character and does so via button combinations instead of a dialogue choice, while party members are computer-controlled. A remake of the game was later released on PlayStation Portable called Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X.</desc>

Wolf from Bull Gator and his crony, Axl. Taz ventures away from his home in Tasmania and must pass through the Amazon Jungle, Amsterdam, Switzerland, the Greek Islands, China, Australia, and more. Those familiar with Taz's character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn't lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level. Food has significant importance how victorious Taz will be in his mission and even becomes functional at some points. The more food Taz consumes, the faster he will advance and the closer he will get to rescuing his friend. The road to the rescue will be littered with obstacles and challenges from Taz's enemies. Fans of the Looney Tunes cartoons will want to own this game as well as anyone who enjoys colorful, fast-paced and challenging game play.</desc>

    <desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the 2001 movie starring Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, this version differs greatly from it's console version.  The main bulk of the game is side-scroller with stages where the player moves from right to left trying to escape a wall of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and even a scene recreating the valley escape in the blimp, but with the same elements.  There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers.

There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn's water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).

There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.</desc>

Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you've come to love. Handheld video games just don't get much more creative (or fun) than this.</desc>

    <desc>The Powerpuff Girls return to the Game Boy Color with their second game, POWERPUFF GIRLS: Paint the Townsville Green. This time around, the evil Gangrene gang is causing trouble in the city and it is up to Buttercup to battle through the town and stop them. Since she is known for her physical strength, Buttercup uses it throughout the game to destroy enemies and anything else that gets in her way. Of course, all this fighting can wear on a girl, but the power-ups scattered throughout the levels will help aid the fight. Along with the power-ups, there are collectable items hidden in the game as well. After collecting these items you can trade them with the other two POWERPUFF games via link cable. Help Buttercup save the day in POWERPUFF GIRLS: Paint the Townsville Green.</desc>

The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football 'kill' with direct hits.

While Tom is looking to beef up his next meal, Jerry is trying to rescue his nephews. Depending on the level, the player has to collect a varying amount of mice during a varying timeframe. Various extras such as bombs, clubs, pans, cheese, a rubber duck and so on help with the task. The player has to run around an 8 way scrolling level and return the mice to his nest/hole (where they could still be bombed, counting for the opponent). Extras can be used to distract, punch, flatten or otherwise execute the opponent, essentially delaying him.

    <desc>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.

The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.

The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</desc>

    <name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</name>
    <desc>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics.

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

    <desc>This is the first handheld version of Tony Hawk's popular skateboarding game. It bears little resemblance to the original Playstation version. It is actually composed of two different events, a half pipe and a race mode.

Half pipe mode is viewed from a side perspective, kind of like the classic Skate or Die game. You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you goal is to perform tricks and get to the end quickly.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

    <desc>On their way to help in the battle against Sargon, a crew of adventurers each skilled in their own way encounter a storm that rips a hole in their ship. Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.

The gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&amp;D games like the Eye of the Beholder series, though not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.</desc>

In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

Play continues until one player is left standing. In both modes, you can play against up to three computer-controlled opponents. You can also play a single human opponent via a link cable. As an added bonus, there are three new cards that are not part of the real-world game. Now you can play UNO by yourself.</desc>

Before he can say "I hate Mario", the box pulls him inside and into a room with a dark figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he can leave. And any treasure he finds he can keep. 

Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can't die from any attacks by the enemy. However he can change form after certain attacks, which can both help and halt his progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside).

Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don't become available to Wario until after completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you have to go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.</desc>

As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

    <name>Wendy: Every Witch Way</name>
    <desc>While exploring her house's attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest.  Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's house!  It's up to Wendy to set things right again!

Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game.  As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself – by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching – you'll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.

Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic.  For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions.  The stars also act as Wendy's health meter – if you get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars left, and you'll lose a life.

At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick.  In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</desc>

    <name>Wings of Fury</name>
    <desc>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.

It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.

 
You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.

The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</desc>

    <name>Worms Armageddon</name>
    <desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. 

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</desc>

The player starts off as one of either four different superstars including The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker or "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, after which the story kicks in.  The story consists of the player's selected wrestler just moments away from winning the WWF Championship before getting hit from behind by an unknown assailant and defeated.  They awake to discover that Stephanie McMahon has also kidnapped and her father Vince promises the player's character another shot at the title if they rescue Stephanie.

There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4's along with many more objects.  Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.

There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player's health and power bar among many others.  Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character's unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy.  There is also an option for a second player to join in using a link cable to team up and help out on their friend's journey.</desc>

The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating the game's story mode.

In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable.

The Game Boy's two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops' eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button combos.</desc>

Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to like this."
Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!"

This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.

Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</desc>

    <name>Zebco Fishing!</name>
    <desc>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to "hit" or "hold". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.

The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension. 

Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</desc>

    <desc>A talking lemur? The only place you might find such a thing is Zobooland, the magical place from the PBS series ZOBOOMAFOO. Embark on a nine-level quest to collect as many Animal Friend Cards as possible, a task that will require lots of interaction and cooperation with other creatures. Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don't eat enough, you'll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won't be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on. The game is certainly designed for younger players, but three skill settings (easy, easier, easiest) allow the game's difficulty to expand as kids grow accustomed to the challenges. Though the journey is long, games can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>
