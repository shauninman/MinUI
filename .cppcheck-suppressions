# Suppressions for cppcheck
#
# Strategy:
# - workspace/all/ (platform-independent): Fully cleaned, zero style warnings
# - Device-specific code: Targeted style suppressions to maintain original style
# - Real bugs: Always fixed, never suppressed
#
# All suppressions are documented with rationale

# Infrastructure noise - not actionable
